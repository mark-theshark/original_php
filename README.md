# A simple database-driven PHP app
###### This repo needs a PHP interpreter, a VS Code PHP XDebug debugging extension


###### Things you need to  do:

* install a PHP interpreter (v7.4) 

* adds the XDebug debugger settings

* adds VS Code extensions (PHP debugger XDebug)

* creates a dev URL (how running PHP apps are sharing with colleagues for feature testing)

* includes a sample config.json for VS Code debugging (port 9000) - look in the payload folder

* start the web server in the repo folder with: /usr/bin/php -S 0.0.0.0:1026 -t .

* to debug, make a breakpoint, and start the debugger, and refresh the screen
